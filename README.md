## **Shareit project** - Educational project to create a service for sharing things.

The ShareIt project provides users, firstly, with an opportunity to tell what things they are willing to share, and secondly, to find the right thing and rent it for some time.

The service allows you to book a thing for certain dates, but also to close access to it for the time of booking from other people. In case the desired thing is not available in the service, users should be able to leave requests. Suddenly, an ancient gramophone, which is strange to even offer for rent, is suddenly needed for a theater production. On request, it will be possible to add new things for sharing.
